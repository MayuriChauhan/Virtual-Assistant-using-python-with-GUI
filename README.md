# Virtual-Assistant-using-python-with-GUI
This virtual assistant project is built using python language, it is a computer assistant that listens to particular vocal commands and returns relevant information or performs specified actions as desired by the user. And its GUI is constructed using QT Designer which provides WYSIWIG user interface and IDE I've used is Pycharm.
